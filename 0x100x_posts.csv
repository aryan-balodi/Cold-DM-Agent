History shows that trade wars eventually resolve through currency adjustments, not prolonged economic warfare.

The Plaza Accords of 1985 offer a blueprint: when trade tensions peaked, five major nations coordinated to weaken the dollar against their currencies. What followed? The S&P 500 surged 229% over the next five years, and gold jumped 77% in just two years.

When currencies rebalance, hard assets historically outperform. Bitcoin and select crypto assets stand to benefit dramatically from coordinated dollar weakening.

Don’t let short-term market noise distract you from the bigger economic picture unfolding.

What most are missing:

• Bitcoin’s run to $109K was uniquely driven by ETF flows and Saylor’s billions—not organic market-wide momentum.
• Ethereum, Solana, and most major tokens haven’t even entered price discovery yet, still below their previous ATHs
• We’re in two different phases simultaneously: mid-cycle correction for BTC, but pre-breakout for most alts

Yes, we’ve seen AI Agent tokens and memecoins crash 80-90%, but these sectors experienced their own mini-cycle that doesn’t represent the broader market. They started from near-zero valuations with nowhere to go but up—similar to DeFi’s summer 2020 run before the real cycle began.

All previous crypto bull markets peaked after extended periods of liquidity expansion, not before. Central banks globally are just beginning their easing cycles, which historically triggers the strongest phase of crypto growth.

The data suggests what we’re seeing is a BTC correction in parallel with most alts still warming up for their real moves. These periods have historically offered the best entry points for outsized returns.

Bybit just suffered the biggest crypto hack in history—but instead of hiding, they faced it head-on. Immediate communication, full transparency, and withdrawals processed without delay. That’s rare in this space.

But here’s the bigger takeaway: no exchange is invincible. Even the most secure platforms can be breached. Bybit covered this one, but history has shown that not every exchange does.

This isn’t just about Bybit—it’s about how you manage risk. If you’re holding long-term, self-custody isn’t just an option, it’s a necessity.

Not your keys, not your crypto. Simple as that."
https://www.instagram.com/p/DGvO8INStaQ/,66,"Most people watch price charts. Smart investors watch the Fed.

When interest rates drop, borrowing gets cheaper, money flows back into markets, and risk-taking increases. That’s when crypto moves.

We’ve seen it before—zero rates in 2020 and 2021 fueled a massive bull run. Rate hikes in 2022 crushed it. And just a few months ago? AI tokens exploded right after the Fed cut rates.

Now, Trump is pushing for lower rates, and the SEC is shifting pro-crypto. The stage is being set.

The question isn’t if crypto moves—it’s when.

Are you paying attention?"
https://www.instagram.com/p/DGqYnE0ykU-/,76,"LIBRA wasn’t just another memecoin. It was a $100M insider scam.

Memecoins aren’t new. They are the latest iteration of a financial phenomenon as old as markets themselves—speculative bubbles driven by narratives, psychology, and herd behavior. From the South Sea Bubble in 1720 to the dot-com mania of the 90s, history has shown that when there’s easy money to be made, people will flock to it.

But this isn’t a crypto problem. It’s a human problem. Greed, hype, and the desire to chase outsized returns are timeless. The only difference now? Memecoins thrive in an environment with zero regulation, full anonymity, and viral internet culture.

This is why they won’t disappear. But there’s a difference between participating with awareness and being manipulated. Know the game you’re playing.

Do memecoins add value to crypto, or are they just a distraction? Let’s hear your take.

AI Agents are the next innovation in the world of artificial intelligence. Many of them are being built with access to a blockchain wallet for payments and a token for ownership in their success.

DeepSeek’s arrival signals a new era of AI: faster innovation at a fraction of the cost. Markets reacted with panic, but a cheaper, more powerful AI stack should be bullish in the long run—especially with Trump pouring $500B into U.S. AI and championing crypto.

Some projects will fade, but the real gems could rocket higher. That’s why we built a refined filtration system to spot the winners early.

Tether made about $10 billion in 2024, and if you held their stablecoin, you got none of it. Now, USUAL is stepping up, aiming to change the game by sharing stablecoin revenue. Sounds perfect—until you look deeper.

In this Reel, we dive into how USUAL plans to redistribute T-bill yield to its token holders, the mechanics behind USD0 (the stablecoin), and why USUAL* means the team and investors hold a never-diluted 10% slice. The question is: will everyday holders get to see real gains, or will dilution keep token price stalling?
